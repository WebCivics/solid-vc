# SolidVC
This package contains a [Verifiable Credentials](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/) framework built on top of [Solid](https://solid.mit.edu/).

### Getting Started
To get started with `solid-vc`, navigate to your local `solid-vc` directory and run `npm run setup`. This script takes care of creating keypairs, authenticating you with Solid, setting up necessary folders in your POD, and anything else you could possibly need to use the platform.

### Launch SolidVC App
In order to launch the SolidVC application, open "http://localhost:PORT", where PORT is typically a 4-5 digit number that is reported to you as an output of `npm start` from above stage above. On startup, you will be prompted to login again.
