# Solid Verifiable Credentials
This package contains a [Verifiable Credentials](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/) ecosystem built on top of [Solid](https://solid.mit.edu/).

### Getting Started
To get started with `solid-vc`, navigate to local `solid-vc` directory and run `source setup.sh`. This script takes care of creating keypairs, authenticating you with Solid, setting up necessary folders in your POD, and anything else you could possibly need to use the platform.

### Launch SolidVC App
In order to launch the SolidVC application, open "http://localhost:PORT", where PORT is typically a 4-5 digit number that is reported to you during the setup stage above. On startup, you will be prompted to login again.
